create a simple source stream that reads from an array.
A pull stream is just an async stream that is called repeatedly.
note that when every item in the array has been called back,
it returns true in the error slot. This indicates the end of the stream.
both err and end mean the stream is over! but there are many possible
ways an error can occur (err && err !== true), and only one way a stream can correctly end (true)
in pull-streams i like to call streams that data comes out of "sources",
(in node they are usually called readables)

  pull-streams don't really have a writable stream per se. "writable" implys that
  the writer is the active partner, and the stream which is written to is passive.
  (like you are when you watch TV. the TV writes its lies into neocortex via your retinas)
  instead of a writable, pull streams have a "sink", that is a reader.
  here the reader is the active party, actively consuming more data.
  When you read a book, you are in control, and must actively turn the pages to get more information.
  so, a sink is a function that you pass a source to,
  which then reads from that function until it gets to the end or decides to stop.

  we could now consume the source with just these two functions.
  sink(values([1,2,3]))
  so simple. we didn't use any librarys, yet, we have streams with 2 way back pressure.
  since the pattern is async, the source can slow down by cb'ing slower,
  and the sink can slow down by waiting longer before calling read again!
  okay, to be useful, we also need a way to transform inputs into different outputs.
  i.e. a transform stream.
  in pull-streams a transform is implemented as a sink that returns a source.

  right now, we could combine these 3 streams by passing them to each other.

  sink(mapper(source))
  this would be equavalent to node's .pipe
  except with node streams it would look like
  source.pipe(mapper).pipe(sink)
  to be honest, it's easier to read if it does left to right.
  because the direction the data flows is the same as you read.
  lets write a quick function that allows us to compose pull streams left-to-right
  pull(source, mapper, sink)

  that means it only gives us the next thing when we ask for it.
