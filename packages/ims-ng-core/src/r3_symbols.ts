/*
 * This file exists to support compilation of @angular/core in Ivy mode.
 *
 * When the Angular compiler processes a compilation unit, it normally writes imports to
 * @angular/core. When compiling the core package itself this strategy isn't usable. Instead, the
 * compiler writes imports to this file.
 *
 * Only a subset of such imports are supported - core is not allowed to declare components or pipes.
 * A check in ngtsc's translator.ts validates this condition. The translator is responsible for
 * translating an external name (prefixed with Éµ) to the internal symbol name as exported below.
 *
 * The below symbols are used for @Injectable and @NgModule compilation.
